# JSON Schema Tour
Welcome to the JSON Schema Tour! In this interactive tour you will be introduced to JSON Schema. You will learn how to use **JSON Schema [draft](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#draft) 2020-12** to validate JSON documents.


## Are there any prerequisites?
**No!** You just need to know what [JSON](https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/what-is-json) is.

## What is JSON Schema?

JSON Schema is a language used for defining the structure  and constraints of a JSON document.  A [_JSON Schema_](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#schema) is a JSON document that you can use to validate or document another JSON, which we call a JSON [instance](https://json-schema.org/learn/glossary#instance).

## First Schema 
Let's start with a simple example.
Consider you have a JSON document of an employee:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 25
}
```
 This JSON document has two properties:
 - `name` with value `John Doe` (string)
 - `age` with value `25` (integer)

**Task:** You are given an incorrect *schema* for above JSON data on the <SideEditorLink/>. Change the `type` of `age` property from `number` to `integer` and validate the JSON data.
